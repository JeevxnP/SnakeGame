# SnakeGame
This is the snake game I coded for the "Introduction to Programming 1" course unit in first year of university (course code COMP16321).
The base of the game was created following a labortory script provided by the department and then I made some customisation and enhancement to it to demonstrate my creativity, problem solving or programming skills.
